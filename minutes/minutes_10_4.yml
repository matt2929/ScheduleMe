Meeting with our TA (ruhan) to discuss our layout for when we submit for
sprint 2 and the requirements for sprint 3.  One minor issue that we ran
into for the Google API is the end time and the ability for it to be displaying
only one standard time.  As of that meeting this issue has been fixed.  The 
second issue has been resolved as well where Jesse and Dave gave us the proper information
to connect to warmachine.cse.buffalo.edu.
